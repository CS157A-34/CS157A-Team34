## Getting started 

### Prerequisites
You need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) prior to installing.
* Install Node.js
    * On Windows, Linux and MacOS, install the latest [Node version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from the Node.js website. 
    
### Set Up Database Schema, Table and Data
* The schema should called `StockWeb`. If the schema name is changed, make sure to change it under `app.js`.
* Go to `/app/backend/client/src/database_setup/` and run the `StockWeb.sql` in MySQL Workbrench or Terminal
* `init.sql` will be creating the tables only (no data insert). 
* Make sure the **Safe Mode** is `OFF`.
    * To Check **Safe Mode** is ON or OFF:
    ``` sql
     mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%safe_updates%';
     +------------------+-------+
     | Variable_name    | Value |
     +------------------+-------+
     | sql_safe_updates | OFF   |
     +------------------+-------+
     1 row in set (0.00 sec)
    ```
    * If the **Safe Mode** is ON, run the sql command below:
    ``` sql
     SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
    ```
